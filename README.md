# mymaths
An attempt to create my simple math library, with functions including automatic differentiation and integration.

Mathparser translates given expression into a special chain, which represents the expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
It also contains function needed to calculate a numerical value of such a chain.

autoDiff in manyvars.h is a function that uses automatic differentiation algorithm to evaluate a numerical value of expression's derivative.
